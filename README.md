telemetry-ios
=============

A generic library for sending telemetry pings from iOS applications to Mozilla's telemetry service.

## Motivation

The goal of this library is to provide a generic set of components to support a variety of telemetry use cases. It tries to not be opinionated about frameworks or HTTP clients. The only dependency is [AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs) for supporting tests.

## Usage

In your application's `AppDelegate`, setup your configuration options:

```swift
let configuration = Telemetry.default.configuration
configuration.appName = "My App"
configuration.appVersion = "1.0"
configuration.updateChannel = "release"
configuration.buildId = "1"
...
```

This library can automatically measure user preferences stored with `NSUserDefaults` for certain ping types. To do this, specify the `NSUserDefaults` key and a default value in the configuration:

```swift
configuration.measureUserDefaultsSetting(forKey: "foo", withDefaultValue: true)
configuration.measureUserDefaultsSetting(forKey: "bar", withDefaultValue: false)
```

The `AppDelegate` is also a good place to add a `TelemetryPingBuilder` for each type of ping you plan on using. This library includes two by default: `CorePingBuilder` and `FocusEventPingBuilder`. Additional ping types can be added by extending the base `TelemetryPingBuilder` class. Simply add the classes for the ping builder types you intend to use:

```swift
Telemetry.default.add(pingBuilderType: CorePingBuilder.self)
Telemetry.default.add(pingBuilderType: FocusEventPingBuilder.self)
```

How you record data in your application depends largely on the ping builder types you are using. For convenience, several methods are accessible right off the root `Telemetry` class for interfacing with the built-in ping builder types.

* Ensure your ping builders are registered before the UIApplication `appDidBecomeActive`, as the library uses that event to trigger the start of recording.
* `recordEvent(_ event: TelemetryEvent)` -- Adds a UI event to be batched and sent for `FocusEventPingBuilder`. There are also several convenience methods for constructing a `TelemetryEvent` and recording it at the same time such as `recordEvent(category: String, method: String, object: String, value: String?, extras: [String : Any?]?)` where `value` and `extras` are both optional.
* `recordSearch(location: SearchesMeasurement.SearchLocation, searchEngine: String)` -- Records that a search was performed for `CorePingBuilder`.

After recording data, it is stored locally in `FileManager.SearchPathDirectory.cachesDirectory` by default. 

When the app is backgrounded, one or more backgroundTasks are started to perform uploading.

### Customizing Ping Data

To modify the final key-value data dict before it gets stored as JSON, install a handler using Telemetry.swift:
`beforeSerializePing(pingType: String, handler: @escaping BeforeSerializePingHandler)`
